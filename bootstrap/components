## Popular Bootstrap Components

You can customized the look of your site by linking an additional CSS file with your custom CSS styles. Simply add a <link> element to your html with a link to a new stylesheet file. Make sure to add this link *after* the link to the Bootstrap's CSS file.

You can add new classes and ids to your HTML code and style it in the new CSS file. You can also overide some bootstrap styles by styling html elements or Bootstrap classes. As long as the <link> tag for your CSS file appears after the <link> tag for the Bootstrap CSS it will take precedence over it.  

Make all of these changes in your own CSS file. Do not change bootstrap.css.
