**Visual hierarchy**

- Does the page have a clearly defined focal point? (The most emphasized element on the page is at the focal point.)
- Are other important elements clearly identified and sufficiently emphasized? (But less so than the element at the focal point.)
- Are elements of lesser importance de-emphasized?

**Grouping**

- Did you group related elements together? (For example, the logo and the tagline should be placed close to each other.)
- Did you create distinct areas on the page for a header, navigation bars, main content area, sidebar(s), footer, as needed.

**Grid**

- Did you use a grid of at least 3 equal-size columns?
- Does your grid include gutters? (spaces between the columns)
- Are most page elements aligned to grid lines?

**Color Scheme**

- Does your design employ consistently a clearly defined color scheme? (2 to 4 colors in addition to black and white are plenty.)
- Is the color scheme appropriate for the topic?

**Typography**

- Are the style of the typefaces used appropriate for the topic?
- Is the text easy to read?
- Did you use a maximum of 2 typefaces (excluding the logo's font)?
- Did you employ typographic properties in a consistent manner? (For example, all titles are styled the same, all paragraph text is styled the same, etc.)
