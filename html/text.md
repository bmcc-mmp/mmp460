## Elements to Mark Emphasis

The **strong** element : used to indicate text that is more important than the rest of the text.

The **em** element: used for stress emphasis. It does not indicate importance but alters the meaning of the sentence. 

The **b** element: does not convey importance or meaning. It is used to offset part of the text from the normal text without conveying any extra importance.

The **i** element: does not convey importance or meaning. It is used to offset part of the text from the normal text without conveying any extra importance.
