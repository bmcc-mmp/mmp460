## HTML elements, tags and attributes

**HTML tags** mark the content of the page. For example <p> marks content as a paragraph and <header> marks the head portion of a page or an element. 
        
Most tags come in pairs. The first opens an *HTML element* and the second closes it. The line below is an example of an *HTML element* which includes the start and end tags, as well as the content.:

        <p>This is a great day</p>
        

This is another html element that in which a paragraph is *nested* inside a div element:

        <div><p>This is a great day</p></div>

An **attribute** is a property of an element. It is written inside the start tag in the following form:

        <tag attribute="value">
        
For example the src attribute points to a fileâ€™s name and location, in the form of a URL:

        <img src="images/flower.gif" />
