What is the difference between HTML **elements** and **tags**?
        <p> 
is a tag and 
        </p>
is a tag too. The first is a start tag and the second is an end tag. 

On the other hand, the following line is an element:

        <p>This is a great day</p>
        
It includes the start and end tags, as well as the content.

This is another element:

        <div><p>This is a great day</p></div>

An **attribute** is a property of an element. It is written inside the start tag in the following form:

        <tag attribute="value">
        
For example the src attribute points to a fileâ€™s name and location, in the form of a URL:

        <img src="images/flower.gif" />
