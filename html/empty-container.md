title: Container and Empty HTML Elements
---
Tags that enclosed content are called **Container Elements**. They consist of opening and closing tags and all content is placed between them. For example:

      <p>content</p>
      <h1>content</h1>

Tags that do not enclosed content are called **Empty Elements**. They do not have a closing tag. Instead, in XHTML they are closed with a /, for example, <br />.

List of Empty Elements:

      <br>
      <link>
      <img>
      <hr>
      <meta>
      <embed>
      <param>
      <area>
      <col>
      <input>
