## Understanding Target Audiences

Your target audiences are the primary user groups of your website or app. A successful product design starts with answering these questions:
- Who are these people? 
- why would they use your product? 
- What are their needs? 

**‘Everyone’ is Not a Target Audience**

The target audience is the group of people most likely to use and benefit from your product. It is NOT every possible person who might be using your product.
 
The target audience is often more than one group, in which case your product will have to meet needs of all targeted groups.
For existing products, the target audience can be defined based on research into their user base. 


## Describing Target Audiences ##

**Demographic**

Basic demographic information is part of every description of a target audience
- Age range: designing for children is obviously different than designing for adults but both groups can be subdivided into smaller groups in a way that reflects cognitive skills, stage in life and generational differences.
- Gender: consider if more men than women are likely to use your products, or the other way around.
- Location: most of the time the country of residence should be acknowledged. For some products it is relevant to narrow it down to a more exact location, or to specify the type of location, for example urban, suburban or rural.


**Mindsets and Motivations**

To understand users relationship to the topic of your site or app answer these additional questions as related to your product:
- What are their hobbies and interests?
- What are their attitudes or opinions?
- What are their frustrations?
- What would be their motivation to use the site/app?

**Experience**

- Do your users have experience using similar products?
- How much do your users know about the topic of the site/app?
- You may need to accommodate users with different levels of computer skills and familiarity with the subject matter.

User research helps synthesize the kind of people that constitute the target audience. Based on this research ux designers often create [personas](personas.md) as a tool to emphasize with the target audience and unerstand their needs.
