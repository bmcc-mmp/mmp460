Your target audiences are the primary user groups of your website or app. A successful product design starts with answering these questions:
- Who are these people? 
- why would they use your product? 
- What are their needs? 

Your target audience should be defined with the following metrics:

### Demographic

Basic demographic information is part of every description of a target audience
- Age range: designing for children is obviously different than designing for adults but both groups can be subdivided into smaller groups in a way that reflects cognitive skills, stage in life and generational differences.
- Gender: consider if more men than women are likely to use your products, or the other way around.
- Location: most of the time the country of residence should be acknowledged. For some products it is relevant to narrow it down to a more exact location, or to specify the type of location, for example urban, suburban or rural.


### Mindsets and Motivations
To understand users relationship to the topic of your site or app answer these additional questions as related to your product:
- What are their hobbies and interests?
- What are their attitudes or opinions?
- What are their frustrations?
- What would be their motivation to use the site/app?
