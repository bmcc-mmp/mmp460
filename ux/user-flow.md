## User Flows

A user flow is a series of sketches that represent a path a user might take meet a goal while using an application. It helps designers plan and design an app that is easy and efficient to navigate and complete tasks. 

Because user flows are rough sketches, either by hand or on a computer, it allows designer to quickly iterate through ideas

**task flow**

A user flow representing a path to complete one task.

User flows describe movement through the application and a step before creating a prototype. If the sketches contain enough details they can form the basis of a rapid prototype

For example, the sketches below represent a the process of submitting an assignment in a mobile classroom app.
