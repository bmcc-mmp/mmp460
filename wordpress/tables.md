Download and install the plugin [TablePress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tablepress/) to add tables functionality to your wordpress site.

**Responsive Tables**

[TablePress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tablepress/) has an extension that can add responsive behaviors to tables.

Read about it [here](https://tablepress.org/extensions/responsive-tables/) and follow the instruction to download an extension plugin. Although it is marked as premium you can use it without paying.

To summarize the instructions, download the plugin extension and install and activate it like a regular plugin. Then change the shortcodes of the tables (in the pages) to [table id=123 responsive=collapse /] when the id is your table id.
