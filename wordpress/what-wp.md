## What is WordPress?

WordPress is a *content management* application that can be used to create websites that are dynamically managed in the browser. Practically speaking, once a WordPress site is installed, you can log into it and use its dashboard to add or change content without the need for coding HTML or CSS. The changes that you make will be instantly added to the website.

WordPress come with many templates, called *themes*, allowing you to create a professional looking site in minutes, without design work. In addition, many 3-party extensions, called *plugins*, can be used to add functionality, like slideshows, forms and even a shopping cart.

WordPress is an open source application that can be downloaded for free from [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/) and installed on a server. It should NOT be confused with wordpress.com, which is a service that hosts wordpress sites for a fee (although it does have a limited free tier).

**A WorPress site is comprised of three main components:**

- **The WordPress application** –  a PHP-based Content Management software that is installed on a server.
- **A database** that stores all the content of the site, including text, images and other media.
- **A theme** – a set of php files that specify the design of the site. Because the theme (the design) is separated from the database (the content)  it can be changed easily without affecting the site’s content and used for different sites.
