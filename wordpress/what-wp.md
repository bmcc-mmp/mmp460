## What is WordPress?

WordPress is a *content management* application that can be used to create websites that are dynamically managed from the browswer. Practically speaking, once a WordPress site is installed, you can log into it and use its dashboard to add or change content without the need for coding HTML or CSS. The changes that you make will be instantly added to the website.

WordPress come with many templates, called *themes*, allowing you to create a professional looking site in minutes, without design work. In addition, many 3-party extentions, called *plugins*, can be used to add functionality, like slideshows, forms and even a shopping cart.

WordPress is an open source free application that can be downloaded from [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/) and installed manually on a server. Alternatively, many internet hosting services provide a one-click installation of WordPress sites. It should NOT be confused with wordpress.com, which is a service that hosts wordpress sites.

**A WorPress site is comprised of three main components:**

- **The WordPress application** –  a PHP-based Content Management software that is installed on the server.
- **A database** that stores all the content of the site, including text, images and other media.
- **A theme** – a set of php files that specify the design of the site. Because the theme (the design) is separated from the database (the content)  it can be changed easily without affecting the site’s content.

**Steps for installing WordPress manually**

1 Download WordPress from [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/)
2 Create a new database
